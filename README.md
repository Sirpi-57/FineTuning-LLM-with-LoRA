# FineTuning-LLM-with-LoRA

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to generate high-quality text responses using a low-resource method like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). The project explores fine-tuning the Qwen 2.5-1.5B model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient training while maintaining the model's performance. The dataset used is the LaMini-instruction dataset, and the fine-tuning is specifically tailored for causal language modeling tasks.

**Explanations of Concepts**

**Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM)**

Fine-tuning refers to the process of training a pre-trained large language model (LLM) on a specific task or dataset to improve its performance. The base model has already been trained on vast amounts of data, and the fine-tuning allows for adaptation to a more task-specific context without the need to train the entire model from scratch.

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**

PEFT is a technique used to fine-tune large language models efficiently. Instead of updating all the parameters of the model, only a subset of parameters (through techniques like LoRA) is fine-tuned, allowing for faster training and reduced computational resource usage. This technique maintains the performance of the original model while minimizing the cost of fine-tuning.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

LoRA is a method of PEFT that adds low-rank adapters to specific layers of the model to adapt to a new task. By freezing most of the pre-trained model's weights and learning only a small number of additional weights, LoRA reduces memory requirements and computational load.

**Project Deliverables**

**Fine-tuned LLM:** The primary deliverable is a fine-tuned version of the Qwen 2.5-1.5B model that can generate task-specific text based on the instructions provided.

**Codebase:** The code includes the following key components:

Dataset loading and preprocessing using Hugging Face's datasets library.
Model setup and loading, along with LoRA integration for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
Training loop using Hugging Face's Trainer API for managing epochs, evaluation, and logging.
Post-processing and evaluation pipeline for generating text based on prompts.

**Inference Pipeline:** A working text generation pipeline that uses the fine-tuned model to generate responses based on instructions, with sample outputs.

**Documentation**: Clear documentation that outlines the steps taken in the project, the model used, datasets, and fine-tuning techniques.

**Future Scope**

**Extend Model Training:** Fine-tune the model on larger, more diverse datasets to improve response generation across various domains.

**Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques:** Experiment with other PEFT techniques, such as AdapterFusion or Prefix-Tuning, to explore different approaches to efficient fine-tuning.

**Deploy Model:** Deploy the fine-tuned model using an API or web service for real-time text generation, allowing for broader use cases such as conversational AI or content creation.

**Explore Other Models:** Fine-tune different LLM architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT-based) using PEFT methods to compare efficiency and performance.

**Optimize for Specific Tasks:** Train the model for domain-specific tasks such as summarization, translation, or sentiment analysis, improving its versatility.
